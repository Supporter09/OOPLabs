1. Is JAVA a Pass by Value or a Pass by Reference programming language? 
- Java Pass by Value. For example, if we pass an object into a method in Java ( swap(DVD dvd1, DVD dvd2) ) then in the method swap only recieve the address value point 
to the dvd1 Object and dvd2 object in the memory so if we try to swap by Obj tmp = dvd1; dvd1 = dvd2; dvd2 = tmp then it won't work. Because it is only dvd1 and dvd2
in the method change value for each other which does not affect original 2 objects.

2. After the call of swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD) why does the title of these two objects still remain?
- As i said earlier, o1 and o2 are just local variables of method swap so swap value of o1 and o2 does not
affect the value of original objects which are jungleDVD and cinderellaDVD. So the value of jungleDVD and cinderellaDVD still remain

3. After the call of changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()) why is the title of the JungleDVD changed?
- In changeTitle, we have passed down the address of jungleDVD object so when we modify the title of dvd ( which is the jungleDVD object)
it also changes the title of jungleDVD because both point to the same Object.

4. Write a toString() method for the DigitalVideoDisc class. What should be the return type of this method?
- The mothod should return a String.
